## Sanu Kumar — I build backend tools that think. 🔍🛠️  

### Who I Am  
Python-first developer turning messy data and complex problems into crisp, production-grade tools.  
250+ LeetCode problems solved means I sweat the edge cases so users don’t have to.  
Strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision — applied to real-world projects that deliver results.

### Core Stack  
Python · Django · Streamlit · LangChain · OpenAI APIs · Tavily  
Automation · Scripting · Web Scraping · PyTorch · Scikit-Learn · OpenCV · MySQL
